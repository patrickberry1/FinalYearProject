did you hear that
they shut down the main reactorwell be destroyed for sure
this is madness
were doomed
therell be no escapefor the princess this time
whats that
r2d2 where are you
at last where have you been
theyre heading in this directionwhat are we going to do
well be sent to the kessel spice minesor smashed into who knows what
wait a minute where are you going
the death star plansare not in the main computer
where are those transmissionsyou intercepted
what have you done with those plans
we intercepted no transmissions
this is a consular shipwere on a diplomatic mission
if this is a consular shipwhere is the ambassador
commander tear this ship apartuntil youve found those plans
and bring me the passengersi want them alive
theres one set for stun
shell be all right
inform lord vader we have a prisoner
hey youre not permitted in thereits restricted
youll be deactivated for sure
dont call me a mindless philosopheryou overweight glob of grease
come out before somebody sees you
secret mission what plans
what are you talking aboutim not getting in there
im going to regret this
 there goes another one
 hold your fire theres no lifeforms
it must have shortcircuited
thats funny the damagedoesnt look as bad from out here
are you sure this thing is safe
darth vader only you could be so bold
the imperial senate will not sit still for thiswhen they hear youve attacked a diplomatic
dont act so surprised your highness
you werent onany mercy mission this time
several transmissionswere beamed to this ship by rebel spies
i want to know what happenedto the plans they sent you
i dont know what youre talking about
im a member of the imperial senateon a diplomatic mission to alderaan
you are part of the rebel allianceand a traitor
take her away
holding her is dangerous
if word of this gets out it could generatesympathy for the rebellion in the senate
i have traced the rebel spies to her
now she is my only linkto finding their secret base
shell die beforeshell tell you anything
leave that to me
send a distress signal and then informthe senate that all aboard were killed
lord vader the battle station plansare not aboard this ship
and no transmissions were made
an escape pod was jettisoned during the fightingbut no lifeforms were aboard
she must have hiddenthe plans in the escape pod
send a detachment down to retrieve themsee to it personally commander
therell be no one to stop us this time
yes sir
how did we get into this mess
i really dont know how
we seem to be made to sufferits our lot in life
ive got to rest before i fall apartmy joints are almost frozen
what a desolate place this is
where do you think youre going
well im not going that way
its much too rocky
this way is much easier
what makes you thinkthere are settlements over there
dont get technical with me
what mission what are you talking about
ive just about had enough of you
go that way
youll be malfunctioning within a dayyou nearsighted scrap pile
and dont let me catch youfollowing me begging for help
because you wont get it

he tricked me into going this way
but hell do no better

r2
r2d2 it is you it is you
someone was in the podthe tracks go off in this direction

dont shoot dont shoot
will this never end
 fine lets go
 luke
luke
luke tell your uncle if he gets a translatorbe sure it speaks bocce
doesnt look like we have much choicebut ill remind him
yeah well take that red one
no not that one
you i suppose youre programmedfor etiquette and protocol
protocol its my primary function siri am wellversed in all the customs
 i have no need for a protocol droid
 of course you havent sir
not in an environment such as thisthats why i have been programmed
i need a droid who understandsthe binary language of moisture vaporators
vaporators sir my first jobwas programming binary load lifters
very similar to your vaporatorsin most respects
 can you speak bocce
 of course its like a second language
 all right shut up ill take this one
 shutting up sir
luke
take these two to the garagei want them cleaned up before dinner
but i was going into tosche stationto pick up some power converters
you can waste time with your friendswhen your chores are done
now come on get to it
all right come on
and the red one come on
come on red lets go
 uncle owen
 yeah
this r2 unit has a bad motivator look
hey what are you trying to push on us
excuse me sir but that r2 unitis in prime condition a real bargain
uncle owen what about that one
what about that blue onewell take that one
take this away
youll be pleased with that one sir
he really is in firstclass conditionive worked with him before
here he comes
okay lets go
dont you forget this
why i should stick my neck out for youis quite beyond my capacity
thank the makerthis oil bath is going to feel so good
ive got such a bad case of dust contaminationi can barely move
it just isnt fair
biggs is rightim never gonna get out of here
is there anything i might do to help
no not unless you can alter timespeed up the harvest
or teleport me off this rock
i dont think so sir
im only a droid and not very knowledgeableabout such things
not on this planet anyway
as a matter of factim not even sure which planet im on
well if theres a bright centerto the universe
youre on the planetthat its farthest from
i see sir
 you can call me luke
 i see sir luke
just luke
and i am c3po humancyborg relations
and this is my counterpart r2d2
hello
you got a lot of carbon scoring herelooks like you boys have seen a lot of action
with all weve been through
sometimes im amazedwere in as good condition as we are
what with the rebellion and all
you know of the rebellionagainst the empire
thats how we came to be in your serviceif you take my meaning sir
 have you been in many battles
 several i think
theres not much to tell
im not much more than an interpreterand not very good at telling stories
well not at making theminteresting anyway
well my little friend
you got something jammedin here real good
were you on a starcruiser or
help me obiwan kenobiyoure my only hope
whats this
what is whathe asked you a question what is that
help me obiwan kenobiyoure my only hope
he says its nothing sirmerely a malfunction
old data pay it no mind
who is she shes beautiful
im afraid im not quite sure sir
i think she was a passengeron our last voyage
a person of some importance i believe
 our captain was
 is there any more to this recording
behave yourself r2youre going to get us into trouble
its all right you can trust himhes our new master
youre my only hope
he says hes the property of obiwan kenobia resident of these parts
and its a private message for him
frankly i dont knowwhat hes talking about
our last master was captain antilles
but with all weve been throughthis r2 unit has become a bit eccentric
obiwan kenobii wonder if he means old ben kenobi
i beg your pardon sir but do you knowwhat hes talking about
i dont know anyone named obiwan
but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea
hes kind of a strange old hermit
i wonder who she is
sounds like shes in troublei better play back the whole thing
he says the restraining bolt hasshortcircuited his recording system
he suggests that if you remove the bolt
he might be able to play backthe entire recording
oh yeah well
i guess youre too smallto run away on me if i take this off
okay
there you go
whered she go bring her backplay back the entire message
what message
the one youve just been playing
the one youre carryinginside your rusty innards
luke luke
ill be right there aunt beru
im sorry sir but he appears to havepicked up a slight flutter
here see what you can do with himill be right back
just you reconsiderplaying that message for him
no i dont think he likes you at all
no i dont like you either
 i think that r2 unit might have been stolen
 what makes you think that
i stumbled across a recordingwhile i was cleaning him
he says he belongs to someonecalled obiwan kenobi
i thought he might have meant old bendo you know what hes talking about
i wonder if hes related to ben
that wizards just a crazy old man
tomorrow take that r2 unit to anchorheadand have its memory erased
thatll be the end of itit belongs to us now
but what if this obiwancomes looking for him
he wont
i dont think he exists anymorehe died about the same time as your father
 he knew my father
 i told you to forget it
your only concern is to preparethose new droids for tomorrow
in the morning i want them on the south ridgeworking on those condensers
yes sir
i think those new droidsare gonna work out fine
in fact i was also thinkingabout our agreement
about me staying on another season
if these new droids work outi want to apply to the academy this year
you mean the next semesterbefore the harvest
sure theres more than enough droids
harvest is when i need you the most
its only one season more
this year well make enoughon the harvest to hire more hands
and then you can goto the academy next year
you must understand i need you here luke
 but its a whole nother year
 its only one more season
thats what you saidwhen biggs and tank left
 where are you going
 looks like im going nowhere
i have to go finish cleaning those droids
owen he cant stay here forevermost of his friends have gone
it means so much to him
ill make it up to him next yeari promise
lukes just not a farmer owenhe has too much of his father in him
thats what im afraid of
 what are you doing hiding back there
 it wasnt my fault sir
please dont deactivate me
i told him not to gobut hes faulty malfunctioning
 kept babbling on about his mission
 oh no
that r2 unit has always been a problem
these astro droidsare getting quite out of hand
even i cant understandtheir logic at times
how could i be so stupidhes nowhere in sight
blast it
pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him
its too dangerous with the sandpeople aroundwell have to wait till morning
luke im shutting the power down
ill be there in a few minutes
boy am i gonna get it
that little droids gonna cause mea lot of trouble
he excels at that sir
come on
have you seen luke this morning
he said he had things to do beforehe started today so he left early
 did he take those new droids with him
 i think so
he better have those units inthe south range repaired by midday
or therell be hell to pay
theres a droid on the scannerdead ahead
it might be our little r2 unithit the accelerator
where do you think youre going
master luke is your rightful owner now
well have no moreof this obiwan kenobi gibberish
dont talk to me of your mission either
youre fortunate he doesnt blast youinto a million pieces right here
no its all rightbut i think wed better go
whats wrong with him now
there are several creaturesapproaching from the southeast
sandpeople or worse
come on lets go have a look
come on
well there are two banthas down therebut i dont see any
wait a second
theyre sandpeople all righti can see one of them now
hello there
come here my little frienddont be afraid
dont worry hell be all right
rest easy son youve had a busy day
youre fortunate to be all in one piece
ben ben kenobi
boy am i glad to see you
the jundland wastesare not to be traveled lightly
tell me young lukewhat brings you out this far
this little droid
i think hes searching for his former master
but ive never seensuch devotion in a droid before
he claims to be the propertyof an obiwan kenobi
is he a relative of yoursdo you know who hes talking about
obiwan kenobi
obiwan
now thats a nameive not heard in a long time
a long time
i think my uncle knows himhe said he was dead
hes not dead
not yet
 you know him
 of course i know him
hes me
i havent gone by the name of obiwan
since oh before you were born
then the droid does belong to you
i dont seem to rememberever owning a droid
very interesting
i think we better get indoors
the sandpeople are easily startled
but theyll soon be backand in greater numbers
3po
where am i i must have taken a bad step
can you stand weve gotta get outof here before the sandpeople return
i dont think i can make ityou go on master luke
theres no sense in you risking yourselfon my account im done for
no youre not what kind of talk is that
quickly theyre on the move
my father didnt fight in the warshe was a navigator on a spice freighter
thats what your uncle told youhe didnt hold with your fathers ideals
thought he should have stayed hereand not gotten involved
 you fought in the clone wars
 yes
i was once a jedi knightthe same as your father
i wish id known him
he was the best starpilot in the galaxy
and a cunning warrior
i understand youve becomequite a good pilot yourself
and he was a good friend
which reminds me
i have something here for you
your father wanted you to have thiswhen you were old enough
but your uncle wouldnt allow it
he feared you might follow old obiwan
on some damnfool idealistic crusadelike your father did
sir if youll not be needing meill close down for a while
sure go ahead
 what is it
 your fathers lightsaber
this is the weapon of a jedi knight
not as clumsy or random as a blaster
an elegant weapon
for a more civilized age
for over a thousand generationsthe jedi knights
were the guardians ofpeace and justice in the old republic
before the dark times
before the empire
how did my father die
a young jedi named darth vader
who was a pupil of mineuntil he turned to evil
helped the empire hunt downand destroy the jedi knights
he betrayed and murdered your father
now the jedi are all but extinct
vader was seducedby the dark side of the force
the force
the force is what gives a jedi his power
its an energy fieldcreated by all living things
it surrounds us and penetrates us
it binds the galaxy together
lets see if we cant figure outwhat you are my little friend
and where you come from
 i saw part of a message
 i seem to have found it
general kenobi years ago you servedmy father in the clone wars
now he begs you to help himin his struggle against the empire
i regret that i am unable to presentmy fathers request in person
but my ship has fallen under attack
and im afraid my missionto bring you to alderaan has failed
i have placed informationvital to the survival of the rebellion
into the memory systems of this r2 unit
my father will know how to retrieve it
you must see this droidsafely delivered to him on alderaan
this is our most desperate hour
help me obiwan kenobiyoure my only hope
you must learn the ways of the forceif youre to come with me to alderaan
alderaan
im not going to alderaan
ive gotta get homeits late im in for it as it is
i need your help lukeshe needs your help
im getting too oldfor this sort of thing
i cant get involved ive got work to do
its not that i like the empirei hate it
but theres nothingi can do about it right now
 its all such a long way from here
 thats your uncle talking
oh boy my unclehow am i ever gonna explain this
learn about the force luke
i can take you as far as anchorhead
you can get a transport thereto mos eisley or wherever youre going
you must do what you feelis right of course
until this battle station is fully operationalwe are vulnerable
the rebel alliance is too well equipped
theyre more dangerous than you realize
dangerous to your starfleet commander
not to this battle station
the rebellion will continue togain support in the imperial senate
the imperial senate will no longerbe of any concern to us
ive just received word that the emperorhas dissolved the council permanently
the last remnants of the old republichave been swept away
thats impossible
how will the emperor maintain controlwithout the bureaucracy
the regional governors now havedirect control over their territories
fear will keep the local systems in line
fear of this battle station
and what of the rebellion
if the rebels have obtained a completetechnical readout of this station
it is possible however unlikely
that they might find a weaknessand exploit it
the plans you refer towill soon be back in our hands
any attack by the rebels against thisstation would be a useless gesture
no matter what technical datatheyve obtained
this station is nowthe ultimate power in the universe
i suggest we use it
dont be too proud of thistechnological terror youve constructed
the ability to destroy a planetis insignificant
next to the power of the force
dont try to frighten us withyour sorcerers ways lord vader
your sad devotionto that ancient religion
has not helped you conjure upthe stolen data tapes
or given you clairvoyance enoughto find the rebels hidden fortress
i find your lack of faith disturbing
enough of this vader release him
as you wish
this bickering is pointless
lord vader will provide us withthe location of the rebel fortress
by the time this station is operational
we will then crush the rebellionwith one swift stroke
it looks like the sandpeople did thistheres gaffi sticks bantha tracks
ive just never heard of themhitting anything this big before
they didnt but we aremeant to think they did
these tracks are sidebyside
sandpeople always ride single fileto hide their numbers
these are the same jawasthat sold us r2 and 3po
and these blast pointstoo accurate for sandpeople
only imperial stormtroopersare so precise
but why would imperial troopswant to slaughter jawas
if they traced the robots herethey may have learned who they sold them to
and that would lead them back home
wait luke
its too dangerous
uncle owen
aunt beru
uncle owen
now your highness we will discussthe location of your hidden rebel base
theres nothing you could have donehad you been there
youd have been killed too
and the droids would now bein the hands of the empire
i want to come with you to alderaan
theres nothing for me here now
i want to learn the ways of the forceand become a jedi like my father
mos eisley spaceport
you will never find a more wretched hiveof scum and villainy
we must be cautious
how long have you had these droids
 three or four seasons
 theyre up for sale if you want them
let me see your identification
you dont need to see his identification
we dont need to see his identification
these arent the droidsyoure looking for
these arent the droids were looking for
he can go about his business
 you can go about your business
 move along
move along move along
i cant abide those jawasdisgusting creatures
go on go on
i cant understand how we got by those troopsi thought we were dead
the force can have a strong influenceon the weakminded
you really think were gonna finda pilot here to take us to alderaan
most of the best freighter pilotsare to be found here
only watch your stepthis place can be a little rough
im ready for anything
come along r2
 hey we dont serve their kind here
 what
your droids theyll have to wait outsidewe dont want them here
wait out by the speederwe dont want any trouble
i heartily agree with you sir
ill have one of those
 he doesnt like you
 im sorry
i dont like you eitheryou just watch yourself
were wanted meni have the death sentence on 12 systems
 ill be careful then
 youll be dead
this little ones not worth the effort
come let me get you something
im all right
chewbacca here is first mateon a ship that might suit us
i dont like the look of this
han solo im captainof the millennium falcon
chewie here tells me youre lookingfor passage to the alderaan system
yes indeed if its a fast ship
fast ship youve never heard ofthe millennium falcon
should i have
its the ship that made the kessel runin less than 12 parsecs
ive outrun imperial starships
not the local bulk cruisers mind you
im talking aboutthe big corellian ships now
shes fast enough for you old man
 whats the cargo
 only passengers
myself the boy two droids
and no questions asked
is it some kind of local trouble
lets just say wed like to avoidany imperial entanglements
well thats the real trick isnt it
and its gonna cost you something extra
10000 all in advance
10000
we could almost buy our own ship for that
but whos gonna fly it kid you
you bet i could im not such a bad pilot
we dont have to sit here and listen
we can pay you 2000 now
plus 15 when we reach alderaan
seventeen
okay you guys got yourselves a ship
well leave as soon as youre readydocking bay 94
ninetyfour
looks like somebodys beginningto take an interest in your handiwork
all right well check it out
17000 those guysmust really be desperate
this could really save my neckget back to the ship get it ready
 youll have to sell your speeder
 thats okay
im never coming backto this planet again
going somewhere solo
yes greedo as a matter of facti was just going to see your boss
tell jabba that ive got his money
its too late
you should have paid him when you had the chance
jabbas put a price on your head so large
every bounty hunter in the galaxywill be looking for you
im lucky i found you first
yeah but this time ive got the money
if you give it to me i might forget i found you
i dont have it with me tell jabba
jabbas through with you
he has no time for smugglers
who drop their shipments at the firstsign of an imperial cruiser
even i get boarded sometimesdo you think i had a choice
you can tell that to jabbahe may only take your ship
over my dead body
thats the idea
ive been looking forward to this for a long time
ill bet you have
sorry about the mess
her resistance to the mind probeis considerable
itll be some time before we canextract any information from her
the final checkout is completedall systems are operational
what course shall we set
perhaps she would respondto an alternative form of persuasion
what do you mean
i think it is time we demonstratedthe full power of this station
 set your course for alderaan
 with pleasure
lock the door r2
check this side of the street
the doors lockedmove on to the next one
i would much rather have gone with master lukethan stay here with you
i dont know what this trouble is aboutbut im sure it must be your fault
you watch your language
all right give it to me ill take it
look at this ever since the xp38came out they just arent in demand
itll be enough
solo come out of there solo
right here jabba
ive been waitin for you
have you now
you didnt think i was gonna run did you
han my boy you disappoint me
why havent you paid me
and why did you fry poor greedo
jabba next time you wanna talk to mecome see me yourself
dont send one of these twerps
han i cant make exceptions
what if everyone who smuggled for me
dropped their cargo at the first sign
of an imperial starship
its not good business
look jabba even i get boarded sometimes
you think i had a choice
but i got a nice easy charter
ill pay ya back plus a little extrai just need a little more time
han my boy youre the best
so for an extra twenty percent
fifteen jabba dont push it
okay fifteen percent
but if you fail me again
ill put a price on your head so big
you wont be able to go near a civilized system
jabba youre a wonderful human being
come on
if the ships as fast as hes boastingwe ought to do well
what a piece of junk
shell make 5 past light speed
she may not look like muchbut shes got it where it counts kid
ive made a lot of specialmodifications myself
but were a little rushed so if youlljust get on board well get outta here
hello sir
which way
all right men load your weapons
stop that ship blast them
chewie get us out of here
oh my id forgottenhow much i hate space travel
looks like an imperial cruiserour passengers are hotter than i thought
hold em offangle the deflector shields
while i make the calculationsfor the jump to light speed
stay sharp theres two more comin intheyre gonna try and cut us off
why dont you outrun emyou said this thing was fast
watch your mouth or youre gonnafind yourself floating home
well be safe enoughonce we make the jump to hyperspace
besides i know a few maneuverswell lose em
heres where the fun begins
how long before you canjump to light speed
itll take a few moments to getthe coordinates from the navicomputer
are you kiddingat the rate theyre gaining
traveling through hyperspaceaint like dustin crops boy
without precise calculationswed fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernovaand that would end your trip real quick
 whats that flashing
 were losing a deflector shield
go strap yourselves inim gonna make the jump to light speed
weve entered the alderaan system
governor tarkin i should have expectedto find you holding vaders leash
i recognized your foul stenchwhen i was brought on board
charming to the last
you dont know how hard i found it
signing the order to terminate your life
im surprised you had the courageto take the responsibility yourself
princess leia before your execution
i would like you to be my guestat a ceremony
that will makethis battle station operational
no star system will dareoppose the emperor now
the more you tighten your grip tarkin
the more star systemswill slip through your fingers
not after we demonstratethe power of this station
in a way you have determinedthe choice of the planet
thatll be destroyed first
since you are reluctant to provide uswith the location of the rebel base
i have chosen to testthis stations destructive power
on your home planet of alderaan
no alderaan is peacefulwe have no weapons
you would prefer another targeta military target
then name the system
i grow tired of asking thisso it will be the last time
where is the rebel base
dantooine
theyre on dantooine
there you see lord vadershe can be reasonable
continue with the operationyou may fire when ready
 what
 youre far too trusting
dantooine is too remoteto make an effective demonstration
but dont worry we will deal withyour rebel friends soon enough
commence primary ignition
are you all right whats wrong
i felt a great disturbance in the force
as if millions of voices suddenlycried out in terror
and were suddenly silenced
i fear something terrible has happened
youd better get on with your exercises
you can forget your troubleswith those imperial slugs
i told you id outrun them
dont everybody thank me at once
anyway we should be at alderaanabout 0200 hours
now be careful r2
he made a fair movescreaming about it cant help you
let him have itits not wise to upset a wookiee
but sir nobody worriesabout upsetting a droid
thats cause a droid dont pull peoples armsout of their sockets when they lose
wookiees are known to do that
i see your point sir
i suggest a new strategy r2let the wookiee win
remember a jedi can feel the forceflowing through him
 you mean it controls your actions
 partially
but it also obeys your commands
hokey religions and ancient weaponsare no match for a blaster at your side kid
you dont believe in the force do you
kid ive flown from one sideof this galaxy to the other
ive seen a lot of strange stuff
but ive never seen anythingto make me believe
theres one allpowerful forcecontrolling everything
theres no mystical energy fieldcontrols my destiny
its all a lot ofsimple tricks and nonsense
i suggest you try it again luke
this time let go your conscious self
and act on instinct
with the blast shield down i cant seehow am i supposed to fight
your eyes can deceive youdont trust them
stretch out with your feelings
you see you can do it
i call it luck
in my experiencetheres no such thing as luck
good against remotes is one thing
good against the livingthats something else
were coming up on alderaan
i did feel somethingi could almost see the remote
thats good youve takenyour first step into a larger world
yes
our scout ships have reached dantooine
they found the remains of a rebel base
but they estimate thatit has been deserted for some time
they are now conducting an extensivesearch of the surrounding systems
she lied she lied to us
i told you she would neverconsciously betray the rebellion
terminate her immediately
stand by chewie here we gocut in the sublight engines
what the
weve come out of hyperspaceinto a meteor shower
some kind of asteroid collision
 its not on any of the charts
 whats going on
our positions correctexcept no alderaan
 where is it
 thats what im trying to tell you
it aint there its been blown away
 what how
 destroyed by the empire
the entire starfleetcouldnt destroy the whole planet
itd take a thousand shipswith more firepower than ive
 theres another ship coming in
 maybe they know what happened
its an imperial fighter
 it followed us
 no its a shortrange fighter
there arent any bases around herewhere did it come from
sure is leaving in a hurryif they identify us were in trouble
not if i can help itchewie jam its transmissions
 let it go its too far out of range
 not for long
a fighter that size couldnt getthis deep into space on its own
he must have gotten lostbeen part of a convoy or something
he aint gonna be aroundlong enough to tell anybody about us
hes heading for that small moon
i can get him before he gets therehes almost in range
thats no moon
 its a space station
 its too big to be a space station
i have a very bad feeling about this
turn the ship around
yeah i think youre right full reverse
chewie lock in the auxiliary power
why are we still moving towards it
were caught in a tractor beamits pulling us in
theres gotta be something you can do
theres nothing i can doim at full power i have to shut down
theyre not gonna get me without a fight
you cant win but there arealternatives to fighting
clear bay 327
we are opening the magnetic field
to your stations come with me
close all outboard shieldsclose all outboard shields
yes
weve captured a freighter enteringthe remains of the alderaan system
its markings match those of a shipthat blasted its way out of mos eisley
they must be trying to returnthe stolen plans to the princess
she may yet be of some use to us
unlock 1 5 7 and 9 release charge
theres no one on board sir
according to the log the crewabandoned ship right after takeoff
it must be a decoyseveral escape pods have been jettisoned
 did you find any droids
 no sir
if there were anythey must also have jettisoned
send a scanning crew aboardi want every part of this ship checked
yes sir
i sense something
a presence ive not felt since
get me a scanning crew in herei want every part of this ship checked
theres no one here
boy its lucky you havethese compartments
i use them for smuggling i neverthought id be smuggling myself in em
this is ridiculous
even if i could take offid never get past the tractor beam
leave that to me
damn fool i knew you were gonna say that
whos the more foolishthe fool or the fool who follows him
the ships all yours if the scannerspick up anything report it immediately
all right lets go
hey down there
could you give us a hand with this
tk421 why arent you at your post
tk421 do you copy
take over weve got a bad transmitterill see what i can do
between his howlingand your blasting everything
its a wonder the whole stationdoesnt know were here
bring em on i prefer a straight fightto sneakin around
weve found the computer outlet sir
plug in he should be able tointerpret the entire imperial network
hes found the controls to the power beamthats holding the ship here
hell try to make the precise locationappear on the monitor
the tractor beam is coupledto the main reactor in seven locations
a power loss at one of the terminalswill allow the ship to leave
i dont think you boys can helpi must go alone
whatever you say ive done more thani bargained for on this trip already
 i want to go with you
 be patient luke watch the droids

ive been waiting for you obiwanwe meet again at last
the circle is now complete
when i left you i was but the learner
now i am the master
only a master of evil darth
your powers are weak old man
you cant win darthif you strike me down
i shall become more powerfulthan you can possibly imagine
you should not have come back
didnt we just leave this party
 what kept you
 we ran into some old friends
 the ship all right
 seems okay if we can get to it
i hope the old man gotthe tractor beam down
look
come on r2 were going
nows our chance go
come on
 luke its too late
 blast the door kid
run luke run
i hope that old man got the tractor beam downor this is gonna be a short trip hit it
were coming up on their sentry ships
hold them off angle the deflectorshields while i charge up the main guns
i cant believe hes gone
there wasnt anything you could have done
come on buddy were not out of this yet
you in kid okay stay sharp
here they come
theyre coming in too fast
 weve lost the lateral controls
 dont worry shell hold together
hear me baby hold together
got him i got him
great kid dont get cocky
theres still two more
 thats it we did it
 we did it
help i think im meltingthis is all your fault
are they away
theyve just made the jumpinto hyperspace
youre sure the homing beaconis secure aboard their ship
im taking an awful risk vader
this had better work
not a bad bit of rescuing huh
you know sometimes i amaze even myself
that doesnt sound too hard
they let us go its the onlyexplanation for the ease of our escape
 you call that easy
 theyre tracking us
not this ship sister
at least the information in r2is still intact
whats so important whats he carrying
the technical readoutsof that battle station
i only hope that when the datasanalyzed a weakness can be found
 its not over yet
 it is for me sister
i aint in this for your revolutionand im not in it for you princess
i expect to be well paidim in it for the money
you neednt worry about your reward
if money is all that you lovethen thats what youll receive
your friend is quite a mercenary
i wonder if he really caresabout anything or anybody
i care
so
what do you think of her han
im trying not to kid
good
still shes got a lot of spirit
what do you thinkyou think a princess and a guy like me
no
youre safe when we heard aboutalderaan we feared the worst
we have no time for sorrows commander
you must use the informationin this r2 unit to help plan the attack
its our only hope
 yes
 were approaching the planet yavin
the rebel base is on a moonon the far side
we are preparing to orbit the planet
the battle station is heavily shielded
and carries a firepowergreater than half the starfleet
its defenses are designed arounda direct largescale assault
a small oneman fighter should be ableto penetrate the outer defense
pardon me for asking sir but what goodare snub fighters against that
the empire doesnt consider a smalloneman fighter to be any threat
or theyd have a tighter defense
an analysis of the plansprovided by princess leia
has demonstrated a weaknessin the battle station
the approach will not be easy
youre required to maneuverstraight down this trench
and skim the surface to this point
the target area is only two meters wide
its a small thermal exhaust portright below the main port
the shaft leads directlyto the reactor system
a precise hitwill start a chain reaction
which should destroy the station
only a precise hit willset up a chain reaction
the shaft is rayshieldedso youll have to use proton torpedoes
thats impossible even for a computer
no its not i used to bullseyewomp rats in my t16 back home
theyre not much bigger than two meters
then man your shipsand may the force be with you
orbiting the planet at maximum velocity
the moon with the rebel basewill be in range in 30 minutes
this will be a day long remembered
it has seen the end of kenobi
and will soon seethe end of the rebellion
all flight crews man your stations
so you got your rewardand youre just leaving then
thats right yeah
i got some old debtsi gotta pay off with this stuff
even if i didnt you dont think id befool enough to stick around here do ya
why dont you come with usyoure pretty good in a fight we could use ya
come on why dont you take a look around
you know whats about to happenwhat theyre up against
they could use a good pilot like youyoure turning your back on them
what goods a rewardif you aint around to use it
besides attacking that battle stationaint my idea of courage
its more like suicide
all rightwell take care of yourself han
i guess thats what youre best atisnt it
hey luke
may the force be with you
what are you looking ati know what im doing

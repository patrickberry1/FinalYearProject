MOTTI,dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station,"00:37:08,930","00:37:13,650", DEATH STAR ,4462580
TAGGE,the rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial senate as long as,"00:37:13,730","00:37:17,360", DEATH STAR ,4471090
TARKIN,the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away,"00:37:17,440","00:37:29,790", DEATH STAR ,4487230

MOTTI,dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways lord vader your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fort,"00:38:21,090","00:38:34,350", DEATH STAR ,4615440
VADER,i find your lack of faith disturbing,"00:38:41,570","00:38:44,190", DEATH STAR ,4645760

WILLARD,youre safe we had feared the worst,"01:38:50,260","01:38:53,470", MASSASSI ,4663730
DODONNA,the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet its defenses are designed around a direct large scale assault a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense,"01:39:24,540","01:39:53,740", MASSASSI ,4758280
GOLD LEADER,pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that,"01:39:55,490","01:39:59,290", MASSASSI ,4794780
DODONNA,well the empire doesnt consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat or theyd have a tighter defense an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station,"01:39:59,370","01:40:13,340", MASSASSI ,4812710
DODONNA,the approach will not be easy you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point the target area is only two meters wide its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port the shaft leads directly to the reactor system a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station,"01:40:14,180","01:40:38,990", MASSASSI ,4853170
DODONNA,only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction the shaft is ray shielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes,"01:40:39,080","01:40:45,870", MASSASSI ,4884950
WEDGE,thats impossible even for a computer,"01:40:45,960","01:40:48,130", MASSASSI ,4894090
LUKE,its not impossible i used to bulls eye womp rats in my tsixteen back home theyre not much bigger than two meters,"01:40:48,210","01:40:54,510", MASSASSI ,4902720

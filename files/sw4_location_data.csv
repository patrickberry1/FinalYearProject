TAGGE,until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable the rebel alliance is too well equipped theyre more dangerous than you realize,"00:37:00,970","00:37:08,850", DEATH STAR ,7880
MOTTI,dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station,"00:37:08,930","00:37:13,650", DEATH STAR ,4720
TAGGE,the rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial senate as long as,"00:37:13,730","00:37:17,360", DEATH STAR ,3630
TARKIN,the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away,"00:37:17,440","00:37:29,790", DEATH STAR ,12350
TAGGE,thats impossible how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy,"00:37:30,450","00:37:34,250", DEATH STAR ,3800
TARKIN,the regional governors now have direct control over territories fear will keep the local systems in line fear of this battle station,"00:37:34,330","00:37:45,470", DEATH STAR ,11140

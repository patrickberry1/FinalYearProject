its another hot sunny day today here in southern california  
temperature is 84 for downtown los angeles  
overnight lows of 75  
i think about that day  
i left him at a greyhound station west of santa fe  
we were 17 but he was sweet and it was true  
still i knew what i had to do  
cause i just knew  
summer sunday nights  
wed sink into our seats right as they dimmed out all the lights  
a technicolor world made out of music and machine  
it called me to be on that screen  
and live inside each scene  
without a nickel to my name hopped a bus here i came  
could be brave or just insane well have to see  
cause maybe in that sleepy town  
hell sit one day the lights are down  
hell see my face and think how he used to know me  
climb these hills im reaching for the heights  
and chasing all the lights that shine  
and when they let you down its another day of  
you get up off the ground its another day of  
cause morning rolls around  
and its another day of sun  
i hear em every day  
the rhythms in the canyons thatll never fade away  
the ballads in the barrooms left by those who came before  
they say you gotta want it more  
so i bang on every door  
and even when the answers no  
or when my moneys running low  
the dusty mic and neon glow are all i need  
and someday as i sing my song  
a smalltown kidll come along  
thatll be the thing to push him on  
and go go  
climb these hills im reaching for the heights  
and chasing all the lights that shine  
and when they let you down its another day of  
you get up off the ground yes its another day of  
cause morning rolls around  
and its another day of sun  
when theyve let you down  
and morning rolls around  
its another day of sun  
its another day of sun  
its another day of sun sun sun sun sun sun  
its another day of sun  
just another day of sun  
its another day of sun  
another day has just begun  
and its another day of sun

my lord did you just say a serious musician  
 i dont think so  can i borrow what youre wearing

so youre an actress i thought you looked familiar  
have i seen you in anything  
uh coffee shop on the warner brothers lot

time to next set  
he doesnt i dont he doesnt tell me what to do  
he just told you what to do  
i know i let him whats your name  
 mia  mia  
guess ill see you in the movies  
 you heard of joseph campbell  uh yeah  
i have this idea to do a reimagining of goldilocks and the three bears  
but from the perspective of the bears  
 the heros journey  it could be like a franchise  
 right  theres a lot we dont know  
there could have been a fourth bear we dont know  
george michael  
hello

thank you for saving the day back there  
well you didnt really give me much of a choice  
its pretty strange that we keep running into each other  
it is strange  
maybe it means something  
 i doubt it  yeah i dont think so  
wheres my car  
you gotta put that thing to your chin  
 this  yeah  
yeah it makes your head into an antenna so  
 ooh  i think it gives you cancer  
 but you find your car faster  what  
you dont live as long but you get where youre going quicker so it all evens out  
that sounds terrible  
 just a suggestion  youre a  
youre a real um whats the word im looking for  
knight in shining armor  
 weirdo that was the word weirdo  okay  
not much to look at huh  
ive seen better  
the sun is nearly gone  
the lights are turning on  
a silver shine that stretches to the sea  
weve stumbled on a view  
thats tailormade for two  
what a shame those two are you and me  
some other girl and guy  
would love this swirling sky  
but theres only you and i  
and weve got no shot  
this could never be  
youre not the type for me  
really  
and theres not a spark in sight  
what a a waste of a lovely night  
you say theres nothing here  
well lets make something clear  
i think ill be the one to make that call  
but youll call  
and though you look so cute in your polyester suit  
 its wool  youre right  
id never fall for you at all  
and maybe this appeals  
to someone not in heels  
or to any girl who feels  
theres some chance for romance  
but im frankly feeling nothing  
is that so  
or it could be less than nothing  
good to know so you agree  
thats right  
what a waste of a lovely night  
ah  
hi greg oh sorry im late  
yeah be there soon okay bye  
 it was just right there  just right here

what are you doing here  
oh you know just meetings and studio heads and  
howd you get on the lot  
i basically just hauled ass past the guard gates  
i think i have 20 minutes until they find me  
you dont have a break coming up do you  
im off in ten minutes so  
can i hide in the bathroom  
 yes  okay  
sorry  
um i actually do have to check im sorry  
thats the window that humphrey bogart and ingrid bergman  
looked out of in casablanca  
 wow  yeah  
i cant believe you work right across the street from that  
 yeah  thats amazing  
what was your bogarts name  
whats his name is it greg  
yeah greg  
right how long have you been  
weve been seeing each other for about a month  
oh thats great  
hes um hes sweet  
anyway i love being around this stuff you know  
i know what you mean  
i get coffee five miles out of the way just so i can be near a jazz club  
 really  yeah the van beek  
 do you know it  mmmmmm  
all the big swing bands used to play there count basie chick webb  
anyway its a sambatapas place now so  
whats a sambatapas place  
its just a samba place where they serve tapas  
 oh  yeah so the jokes on history  
i dont know thats la  
they just worship everything and they value nothing  
were about to roll stop please guys  
okay  
 youre rolling  yeah  
i know they shoot movies on my street all the time so i know about movies  
 come this way  great  
its a lockdown  
 i love her  and here we go  
hey howd you get into all this  
and roll  
 get into what  sound speed  
you know movies acting  
 action  oh um  
 my aunt was an actress  oh okay  
she was in a traveling theater company  
i grew up in boulder city nevada  
so across the street from my house there was this little library  
that had an old movie section  
so she took me and we spent an entire day watching all these old movies  
like notorious and bringing up baby and casablanca  
 and  cut it there cut  
 check the gate  so we can talk now  
 she sounds incredible  she was incredible  
and i would put on all these plays in my bedroom  
and it would basically just be she and i reenacting those scenes from the movies  
and then i would write my own plays  
 wow  um yeah  
i love it  
so anyway i left college after two years to come here  
and my last audition was for a teen show  
pitched as dangerous minds meets the oc  
so yeah shouldve been a lawyer  
cause the world needs more lawyers  
it doesnt need more actresses  
youre not just an actress  
 what do you mean just an actress  you said it yourself  
youre a child prodigy playwright  
that is not what i said  
well youre too modest to say it but its true  
you could just write your own roles you know  
write something thats as interesting as you are  
and you dont have to audition for this  
 uh piece of caca  yeah  
look at louis armstrong  
he couldve just played the marching band charts that he was given  
but he didnt do it what did he do  
 what did he do  well he made history didnt he  
well im gonna stop auditioning and im gonna make history instead  
well my work is done here  
i should probably tell you something now just to get it out of the way  
 mmmhmm  i hate jazz  
are you okay  
what do you mean you hate jazz  
it just means that when i listen to it i dont like it  
yeah but its such a blanket statement you dont like jazz  
what are you doing right now  
nothing  
i just think that people when they say that they  
you know hate jazz they just  
they dont have context they dont know where it comes from  
jazz was born in a little flophouse in new orleans  
and its just because people were crammed in there  
they spoke five different languages they couldnt talk to each other  
the only way they could communicate was with jazz  
yeah but what about kenny g  
 what  what about kenny g  
i mean what about elevator music  
you know jazz music that i know  
 what about it  from my life  
 mmmhmm  i just find it relaxing  
its not relaxing its not its not  
sidney bechet shot somebody because they told him he played a wrong note  
thats hardly relaxing  
yeah but where i grew up there was this station called kjazz 103  
and people would just put on that station when they had a cocktail party  
right  
and everyone would kinda just talk over it  
i know  
 cause it was  thats the prob  
okay okay so i think thats part of the problem  
is that you cant hear it you know you have to see it  
you have to see whats at stake i mean look at these fellas  
look at the sax player right now  
he just hijacked the song hes on his own trip  
every one of these guys is composing  
theyre rearranging theyre writing  
then theyre playing the melody theyre just  
and now look the trumpet player  
hes got his own idea  
and so its conflict and its compromise and its just  
its new every time  
its brandnew every night its very very exciting  
and its dying its dying mia  
its dying on the vine  
and the world says let it die it had its time  
well not on my watch  
 what are you gonna do  im gonna have my own club  
 really  yes  
were gonna play whatever we want whenever we want  
however we want as long as its pure jazz  
hi this is mia dolan  
yeah i just missed a call  
 i got a callback  what come on for what  
for a tv show the one i was telling you about earlier  
 the dangerous minds meets the oc  yeah  
 congratulations thats incredible  its really exciting  
i feel like i said negative stuff about it before  
 what  its like rebel without a cause  
sort of  
i got the bullets  
yes

yeah you dont want to explore too far  
kind of a natives are restless sort of thing  
actually chinas going to build a canal  
im sorry  
the immensity of our universe  
for many days before the end of our earth  
people will look into the night sky  
and notice a star increasingly bright and increasingly near  
as this star approaches us  
jim stark  
ill go find a place im sorry  
as this star approaches us  
the weather will change  
the great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide  
and the seas will turn warm  
the last of us search the heavens and stand amazed  
for the stars will still be there and will be  
mmm  
i have an idea  
what is that is it a script

 what  cause no one will come  
to chicken on a stick  
is that a music note as an apostrophe

 im not droppin the chicken  you could maybe do it somewhere else

jazz is dying because of people like you  
youre playin to 90yearolds at the lighthouse  
where are the kids where are the young people  
youre so obsessed with kenny clarke and thelonious monk  
these guys were revolutionaries  
how are you gonna be a revolutionary if youre such a traditionalist  
youre holdin onto the past but jazz is about the future

piece of caca  
 you nervous about what they think  im nervous to do it  
im nervous to get up on a stage and perform for people  
i mean i dont need to say that to you  
 its gonna be incredible  you dont get it but im terrified  
they should be so lucky to see it i cant wait  
i can  
when do you leave the morning

to boise  
yeah you can knock that off your bucket list  
oh that would be really exciting i wish i could  
what are you doing after the tour  
why cant you  
 come to boise  yeah  
cause i have to rehearse  
but cant you rehearse anywhere  
anywhere you are  
i mean i guess  
um well all my stuff is here and its in two weeks  
so i dont really think that would be  
 okay well  the best idea right now but  
i wish i could  
were just gonna have to try and see each other  
we almost never see each other  
i know but when are you done  
what do you mean i mean  
when are you finished with the whole tour  
after we finish were gonna go and record and then we go back on tour  
you know we tour so we can make the record  
so we can go back and tour the record  
so its like the long haul  
what do you mean the long haul  
i mean the long haul like youre gonna stay in this band for a long time  
on tour  
what did you think i was gonna do  
i dont i hadnt really thought it through  
i didnt know that the band  
 was so important  you didnt think it would be successful  
um  
no thats not really what i mean i just mean that you  
youre gonna be on tour for what months now years  
yeah i dont believe this is it  
i mean it could feasibly be  
i could be on tour with this for a couple of years at least  
just this record  
do you like the music youre playing  
i dont  
i dont know what it matters  
well it matters because if youre gonna give up your dream  
i think it matters that you like what youre playing on the road for years  
do you like the music im playing  
yeah i do  
i just didnt think that you did  
 yeah well  you always said keith is the worst  
and now youre gonna be on tour with him for years so i just didnt  
 what are you doing right now  know if you were happy  
 why are you doing this  i dont  
 what do you mean why am i doing this  i thought you wanted me to do this  
it just sounds like now you dont want me to do it  
what do you mean i wanted you to do this  
this is what you wanted for me  
to be in this band  
to be in a band to have a steady job you know  
to be you know  
of course i wanted you to have a steady job  
so that you could take care of yourself and your life  
and you could start your club  
so im doing that so i dont understand why arent we celebrating  
why arent you starting your club  
you said yourself no one wants to go to that club  
no one wants to go to a club called chicken on a stick  
so change the name  
well no one likes jazz not even you  
i do like jazz now because of you  
and this is what i thought you wanted me to do  
what am i supposed to do go back to playing jingle bells  
im not saying that  
im saying why dont you take what youve made and start the club  
scraping pennies so i can start a club no one wants to go to  
people will want to go to it because youre passionate about it  
and people love what other people are passionate about  
 you remind people of what they forgot  not in my experience  
well whatever all right its just time to grow up you know  
i have a steady job this is what im doing  
and now all of a sudden if you had these problems  
i wish you would have said them earlier  
before i signed on the goddamn dotted line  
im pointing out that you had a dream  
that you followed that you were sticking to  
this is the dream this is the dream  
this is not your dream  
guys like me work their whole lives to be in something  
thats successful that people like you know  
i mean im finally in something that people enjoy  
since when do you care about being liked  
just cause i dont enjoy it it doesnt matter

um  
whenever youre ready  
my aunt used to live in paris

i remember  
she told us that she jumped into the river once  
barefoot  
she smiled  
leapt without looking  
and tumbled into  
the seine  
the water was freezing  
she spent a month sneezing  
but said she would do it again  
heres to the ones who dream  
foolish as they may seem  
heres to the hearts that ache  
heres to the mess we make  
she captured a feeling  
sky with no ceiling  
the sunset inside a frame  
she lived in her liquor  
and died with a flicker  
ill always remember the flame  
heres to the ones who dream  
foolish as they may seem  
heres to the hearts that ache  
heres to the mess we make  
she told me  
a bit of madness is key  
to give us new colors to see  
who knows where it will lead us  
and thats why they need us  
so bring on the rebels  
the ripples from pebbles  
the painters and poets and plays  
and heres to the fools  
who dream  
crazy as they may seem  
heres to the hearts that break  
heres to the mess  
we make  
i  
trace it all back to then  
her and the snow and the seine  
smiling through it

did you hear that  
they shut down the main reactor well be destroyed for sure  
this is madness  
were doomed  
therell be no escape for the princess this time  
whats that  
r2d2 where are you  
at last where have you been  
theyre heading in this direction what are we going to do  
well be sent to the kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what  
wait a minute where are you going  
the death star plans are not in the main computer  
where are those transmissions you intercepted  
what have you done with those plans  
we intercepted no transmissions  
this is a consular ship were on a diplomatic mission  
if this is a consular ship where is the ambassador  
commander tear this ship apart until youve found those plans  
and bring me the passengers i want them alive  
theres one set for stun  
shell be all right  
inform lord vader we have a prisoner  
hey youre not permitted in there its restricted  
youll be deactivated for sure  
dont call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease  
come out before somebody sees you  
secret mission what plans  
what are you talking about im not getting in there  
im going to regret this  
 there goes another one  hold your fire theres no lifeforms  
it must have shortcircuited  
thats funny the damage doesnt look as bad from out here  
are you sure this thing is safe  
darth vader only you could be so bold  
the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear youve attacked a diplomatic  
dont act so surprised your highness  
you werent on any mercy mission this time  
several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies  
i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you  
i dont know what youre talking about  
im a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan  
you are part of the rebel alliance and a traitor  
take her away  
holding her is dangerous  
if word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate  
i have traced the rebel spies to her  
now she is my only link to finding their secret base  
shell die before shell tell you anything  
leave that to me  
send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed  
lord vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship  
and no transmissions were made  
an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no lifeforms were aboard  
she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod  
send a detachment down to retrieve them see to it personally commander  
therell be no one to stop us this time  
yes sir  
how did we get into this mess  
i really dont know how  
we seem to be made to suffer its our lot in life  
ive got to rest before i fall apart my joints are almost frozen  
what a desolate place this is  
where do you think youre going  
well im not going that way  
its much too rocky  
this way is much easier  
what makes you think there are settlements over there  
dont get technical with me  
what mission what are you talking about  
ive just about had enough of you  
go that way  
youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile  
and dont let me catch you following me begging for help  
because you wont get it  
no more adventures  
im not going that way  
that malfunctioning little twerp this is all his fault  
he tricked me into going this way  
but hell do no better  
wait whats that  
a transport im saved  
over here  
hey hey  
help please help  
r2  
r2d2 it is you it is you  
someone was in the pod the tracks go off in this direction  
look sir droids  
we stopped  
wake up wake up  
were doomed  
do you think theyll melt us down  
dont shoot dont shoot  
will this never end  
 fine lets go  luke  
luke  
luke tell your uncle if he gets a translator be sure it speaks bocce  
doesnt look like we have much choice but ill remind him  
yeah well take that red one  
no not that one  
you i suppose youre programmed for etiquette and protocol  
protocol its my primary function sir i am wellversed in all the customs  
 i have no need for a protocol droid  of course you havent sir  
not in an environment such as this thats why i have been programmed  
i need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators  
vaporators sir my first job was programming binary load lifters  
very similar to your vaporators in most respects  
 can you speak bocce  of course its like a second language  
 all right shut up ill take this one  shutting up sir  
luke  
take these two to the garage i want them cleaned up before dinner  
but i was going into tosche station to pick up some power converters  
you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done  
now come on get to it  
all right come on  
and the red one come on  
come on red lets go  
 uncle owen  yeah  
this r2 unit has a bad motivator look  
hey what are you trying to push on us  
excuse me sir but that r2 unit is in prime condition a real bargain  
uncle owen what about that one  
what about that blue one well take that one  
take this away  
youll be pleased with that one sir  
he really is in firstclass condition ive worked with him before  
here he comes  
okay lets go  
dont you forget this  
why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity  
thank the maker this oil bath is going to feel so good  
ive got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move  
it just isnt fair  
biggs is right im never gonna get out of here  
is there anything i might do to help  
no not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest  
or teleport me off this rock  
i dont think so sir  
im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things  
not on this planet anyway  
as a matter of fact im not even sure which planet im on  
well if theres a bright center to the universe  
youre on the planet that its farthest from  
i see sir  
 you can call me luke  i see sir luke  
just luke  
and i am c3po humancyborg relations  
and this is my counterpart r2d2  
hello  
you got a lot of carbon scoring here looks like you boys have seen a lot of action  
with all weve been through  
sometimes im amazed were in as good condition as we are  
what with the rebellion and all  
you know of the rebellion against the empire  
thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir  
 have you been in many battles  several i think  
theres not much to tell  
im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories  
well not at making them interesting anyway  
well my little friend  
you got something jammed in here real good  
were you on a starcruiser or  
help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope  
whats this  
what is what he asked you a question what is that  
help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope  
he says its nothing sir merely a malfunction  
old data pay it no mind  
who is she shes beautiful  
im afraid im not quite sure sir  
i think she was a passenger on our last voyage  
a person of some importance i believe  
 our captain was  is there any more to this recording  
behave yourself r2 youre going to get us into trouble  
its all right you can trust him hes our new master  
youre my only hope  
he says hes the property of obiwan kenobi a resident of these parts  
and its a private message for him  
frankly i dont know what hes talking about  
our last master was captain antilles  
but with all weve been through this r2 unit has become a bit eccentric  
obiwan kenobi i wonder if he means old ben kenobi  
i beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about  
i dont know anyone named obiwan  
but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea  
hes kind of a strange old hermit  
i wonder who she is  
sounds like shes in trouble i better play back the whole thing  
he says the restraining bolt has shortcircuited his recording system  
he suggests that if you remove the bolt  
he might be able to play back the entire recording  
oh yeah well  
i guess youre too small to run away on me if i take this off  
okay  
there you go  
whered she go bring her back play back the entire message  
what message  
the one youve just been playing  
the one youre carrying inside your rusty innards  
luke luke  
ill be right there aunt beru  
im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter  
here see what you can do with him ill be right back  
just you reconsider playing that message for him  
no i dont think he likes you at all  
no i dont like you either  
 i think that r2 unit might have been stolen  what makes you think that  
i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him  
he says he belongs to someone called obiwan kenobi  
i thought he might have meant old ben do you know what hes talking about  
i wonder if hes related to ben  
that wizards just a crazy old man  
tomorrow take that r2 unit to anchorhead and have its memory erased  
thatll be the end of it it belongs to us now  
but what if this obiwan comes looking for him  
he wont  
i dont think he exists anymore he died about the same time as your father  
 he knew my father  i told you to forget it  
your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow  
in the morning i want them on the south ridge working on those condensers  
yes sir  
i think those new droids are gonna work out fine  
in fact i was also thinking about our agreement  
about me staying on another season  
if these new droids work out i want to apply to the academy this year  
you mean the next semester before the harvest  
sure theres more than enough droids  
harvest is when i need you the most  
its only one season more  
this year well make enough on the harvest to hire more hands  
and then you can go to the academy next year  
you must understand i need you here luke  
 but its a whole nother year  its only one more season  
thats what you said when biggs and tank left  
 where are you going  looks like im going nowhere  
i have to go finish cleaning those droids  
owen he cant stay here forever most of his friends have gone  
it means so much to him  
ill make it up to him next year i promise  
lukes just not a farmer owen he has too much of his father in him  
thats what im afraid of  
 what are you doing hiding back there  it wasnt my fault sir  
please dont deactivate me  
i told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning  
 kept babbling on about his mission  oh no  
that r2 unit has always been a problem  
these astro droids are getting quite out of hand  
even i cant understand their logic at times  
how could i be so stupid hes nowhere in sight  
blast it  
pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him  
its too dangerous with the sandpeople around well have to wait till morning  
luke im shutting the power down  
ill be there in a few minutes  
boy am i gonna get it  
that little droids gonna cause me a lot of trouble  
he excels at that sir  
come on  
have you seen luke this morning  
he said he had things to do before he started today so he left early  
 did he take those new droids with him  i think so  
he better have those units in the south range repaired by midday  
or therell be hell to pay  
theres a droid on the scanner dead ahead  
it might be our little r2 unit hit the accelerator  
where do you think youre going  
master luke is your rightful owner now  
well have no more of this obiwan kenobi gibberish  
dont talk to me of your mission either  
youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here  
no its all right but i think wed better go  
whats wrong with him now  
there are several creatures approaching from the southeast  
sandpeople or worse  
come on lets go have a look  
come on  
well there are two banthas down there but i dont see any  
wait a second  
theyre sandpeople all right i can see one of them now  
hello there  
come here my little friend dont be afraid  
dont worry hell be all right  
rest easy son youve had a busy day  
youre fortunate to be all in one piece  
ben ben kenobi  
boy am i glad to see you  
the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly  
tell me young luke what brings you out this far  
this little droid  
i think hes searching for his former master  
but ive never seen such devotion in a droid before  
he claims to be the property of an obiwan kenobi  
is he a relative of yours do you know who hes talking about  
obiwan kenobi  
obiwan  
now thats a name ive not heard in a long time  
a long time  
i think my uncle knows him he said he was dead  
hes not dead  
not yet  
 you know him  of course i know him  
hes me  
i havent gone by the name of obiwan  
since oh before you were born  
then the droid does belong to you  
i dont seem to remember ever owning a droid  
very interesting  
i think we better get indoors  
the sandpeople are easily startled  
but theyll soon be back and in greater numbers  
3po  
where am i i must have taken a bad step  
can you stand weve gotta get out of here before the sandpeople return  
i dont think i can make it you go on master luke  
theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account im done for  
no youre not what kind of talk is that  
quickly theyre on the move  
my father didnt fight in the wars he was a navigator on a spice freighter  
thats what your uncle told you he didnt hold with your fathers ideals  
thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved  
 you fought in the clone wars  yes  
i was once a jedi knight the same as your father  
i wish id known him  
he was the best starpilot in the galaxy  
and a cunning warrior  
i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself  
and he was a good friend  
which reminds me  
i have something here for you  
your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough  
but your uncle wouldnt allow it  
he feared you might follow old obiwan  
on some damnfool idealistic crusade like your father did  
sir if youll not be needing me ill close down for a while  
sure go ahead  
 what is it  your fathers lightsaber  
this is the weapon of a jedi knight  
not as clumsy or random as a blaster  
an elegant weapon  
for a more civilized age  
for over a thousand generations the jedi knights  
were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic  
before the dark times  
before the empire  
how did my father die  
a young jedi named darth vader  
who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil  
helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights  
he betrayed and murdered your father  
now the jedi are all but extinct  
vader was seduced by the dark side of the force  
the force  
the force is what gives a jedi his power  
its an energy field created by all living things  
it surrounds us and penetrates us  
it binds the galaxy together  
lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend  
and where you come from  
 i saw part of a message  i seem to have found it  
general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars  
now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire  
i regret that i am unable to present my fathers request in person  
but my ship has fallen under attack  
and im afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed  
i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion  
into the memory systems of this r2 unit  
my father will know how to retrieve it  
you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan  
this is our most desperate hour  
help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope  
you must learn the ways of the force if youre to come with me to alderaan  
alderaan  
im not going to alderaan  
ive gotta get home its late im in for it as it is  
i need your help luke she needs your help  
im getting too old for this sort of thing  
i cant get involved ive got work to do  
its not that i like the empire i hate it  
but theres nothing i can do about it right now  
 its all such a long way from here  thats your uncle talking  
oh boy my uncle how am i ever gonna explain this  
learn about the force luke  
i can take you as far as anchorhead  
you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever youre going  
you must do what you feel is right of course  
until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable  
the rebel alliance is too well equipped  
theyre more dangerous than you realize  
dangerous to your starfleet commander  
not to this battle station  
the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate  
the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us  
ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently  
the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away  
thats impossible  
how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy  
the regional governors now have direct control over their territories  
fear will keep the local systems in line  
fear of this battle station  
and what of the rebellion  
if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station  
it is possible however unlikely  
that they might find a weakness and exploit it  
the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands  
any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture  
no matter what technical data theyve obtained  
this station is now the ultimate power in the universe  
i suggest we use it  
dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed  
the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant  
next to the power of the force  
dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways lord vader  
your sad devotion to that ancient religion  
has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes  
or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fortress  
i find your lack of faith disturbing  
enough of this vader release him  
as you wish  
this bickering is pointless  
lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress  
by the time this station is operational  
we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke  
it looks like the sandpeople did this theres gaffi sticks bantha tracks  
ive just never heard of them hitting anything this big before  
they didnt but we are meant to think they did  
these tracks are sidebyside  
sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers  
these are the same jawas that sold us r2 and 3po  
and these blast points too accurate for sandpeople  
only imperial stormtroopers are so precise  
but why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas  
if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to  
and that would lead them back home  
wait luke  
its too dangerous  
uncle owen  
aunt beru  
uncle owen  
now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base  
theres nothing you could have done had you been there  
youd have been killed too  
and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire  
i want to come with you to alderaan  
theres nothing for me here now  
i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father  
mos eisley spaceport  
you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy  
we must be cautious  
how long have you had these droids  
 three or four seasons  theyre up for sale if you want them  
let me see your identification  
you dont need to see his identification  
we dont need to see his identification  
these arent the droids youre looking for  
these arent the droids were looking for  
he can go about his business  
 you can go about your business  move along  
move along move along  
i cant abide those jawas disgusting creatures  
go on go on  
i cant understand how we got by those troops i thought we were dead  
the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded  
you really think were gonna find a pilot here to take us to alderaan  
most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here  
only watch your step this place can be a little rough  
im ready for anything  
come along r2  
 hey we dont serve their kind here  what  
your droids theyll have to wait outside we dont want them here  
wait out by the speeder we dont want any trouble  
i heartily agree with you sir  
ill have one of those  
 he doesnt like you  im sorry  
i dont like you either you just watch yourself  
were wanted men i have the death sentence on 12 systems  
 ill be careful then  youll be dead  
this little ones not worth the effort  
come let me get you something  
im all right  
chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us  
i dont like the look of this  
han solo im captain of the millennium falcon  
chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the alderaan system  
yes indeed if its a fast ship  
fast ship youve never heard of the millennium falcon  
should i have  
its the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs  
ive outrun imperial starships  
not the local bulk cruisers mind you  
im talking about the big corellian ships now  
shes fast enough for you old man  
 whats the cargo  only passengers  
myself the boy two droids  
and no questions asked  
is it some kind of local trouble  
lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements  
well thats the real trick isnt it  
and its gonna cost you something extra  
10000 all in advance  
10000  
we could almost buy our own ship for that  
but whos gonna fly it kid you  
you bet i could im not such a bad pilot  
we dont have to sit here and listen  
we can pay you 2000 now  
plus 15 when we reach alderaan  
seventeen  
okay you guys got yourselves a ship  
well leave as soon as youre ready docking bay 94  
ninetyfour  
looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork  
all right well check it out  
17000 those guys must really be desperate  
this could really save my neck get back to the ship get it ready  
 youll have to sell your speeder  thats okay  
im never coming back to this planet again  
going somewhere solo  
yes greedo as a matter of fact i was just going to see your boss  
tell jabba that ive got his money  
its too late  
you should have paid him when you had the chance  
jabbas put a price on your head so large  
every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you  
im lucky i found you first  
yeah but this time ive got the money  
if you give it to me i might forget i found you  
i dont have it with me tell jabba  
jabbas through with you  
he has no time for smugglers  
who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser  
even i get boarded sometimes do you think i had a choice  
you can tell that to jabba he may only take your ship  
over my dead body  
thats the idea  
ive been looking forward to this for a long time  
ill bet you have  
sorry about the mess  
her resistance to the mind probe is considerable  
itll be some time before we can extract any information from her  
the final checkout is completed all systems are operational  
what course shall we set  
perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion  
what do you mean  
i think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station  
 set your course for alderaan  with pleasure  
lock the door r2  
check this side of the street  
the doors locked move on to the next one  
i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you  
i dont know what this trouble is about but im sure it must be your fault  
you watch your language  
all right give it to me ill take it  
look at this ever since the xp38 came out they just arent in demand  
itll be enough  
solo come out of there solo  
right here jabba  
ive been waitin for you  
have you now  
you didnt think i was gonna run did you  
han my boy you disappoint me  
why havent you paid me  
and why did you fry poor greedo  
jabba next time you wanna talk to me come see me yourself  
dont send one of these twerps  
han i cant make exceptions  
what if everyone who smuggled for me  
dropped their cargo at the first sign  
of an imperial starship  
its not good business  
look jabba even i get boarded sometimes  
you think i had a choice  
but i got a nice easy charter  
ill pay ya back plus a little extra i just need a little more time  
han my boy youre the best  
so for an extra twenty percent  
fifteen jabba dont push it  
okay fifteen percent  
but if you fail me again  
ill put a price on your head so big  
you wont be able to go near a civilized system  
jabba youre a wonderful human being  
come on  
if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well  
what a piece of junk  
shell make 5 past light speed  
she may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid  
ive made a lot of special modifications myself  
but were a little rushed so if youll just get on board well get outta here  
hello sir  
which way  
all right men load your weapons  
stop that ship blast them  
chewie get us out of here  
oh my id forgotten how much i hate space travel  
looks like an imperial cruiser our passengers are hotter than i thought  
hold em off angle the deflector shields  
while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed  
stay sharp theres two more comin in theyre gonna try and cut us off  
why dont you outrun em you said this thing was fast  
watch your mouth or youre gonna find yourself floating home  
well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace  
besides i know a few maneuvers well lose em  
heres where the fun begins  
how long before you can jump to light speed  
itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer  
are you kidding at the rate theyre gaining  
traveling through hyperspace aint like dustin crops boy  
without precise calculations wed fly right through a star  
or bounce too close to a supernova and that would end your trip real quick  
 whats that flashing  were losing a deflector shield  
go strap yourselves in im gonna make the jump to light speed  
weve entered the alderaan system  
governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vaders leash  
i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board  
charming to the last  
you dont know how hard i found it  
signing the order to terminate your life  
im surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself  
princess leia before your execution  
i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony  
that will make this battle station operational  
no star system will dare oppose the emperor now  
the more you tighten your grip tarkin  
the more star systems will slip through your fingers  
not after we demonstrate the power of this station  
in a way you have determined the choice of the planet  
thatll be destroyed first  
since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base  
i have chosen to test this stations destructive power  
on your home planet of alderaan  
no alderaan is peaceful we have no weapons  
you would prefer another target a military target  
then name the system  
i grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time  
where is the rebel base  
dantooine  
theyre on dantooine  
there you see lord vader she can be reasonable  
continue with the operation you may fire when ready  
 what  youre far too trusting  
dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration  
but dont worry we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough  
commence primary ignition  
are you all right whats wrong  
i felt a great disturbance in the force  
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror  
and were suddenly silenced  
i fear something terrible has happened  
youd better get on with your exercises  
you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  
i told you id outrun them  
dont everybody thank me at once  
anyway we should be at alderaan about 0200 hours  
now be careful r2  
he made a fair move screaming about it cant help you  
let him have it its not wise to upset a wookiee  
but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid  
thats cause a droid dont pull peoples arms out of their sockets when they lose  
wookiees are known to do that  
i see your point sir  
i suggest a new strategy r2 let the wookiee win  
remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him  
 you mean it controls your actions  partially  
but it also obeys your commands  
hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side kid  
you dont believe in the force do you  
kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  
ive seen a lot of strange stuff  
but ive never seen anything to make me believe  
theres one allpowerful force controlling everything  
theres no mystical energy field controls my destiny  
its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense  
i suggest you try it again luke  
this time let go your conscious self  
and act on instinct  
with the blast shield down i cant see how am i supposed to fight  
your eyes can deceive you dont trust them  
stretch out with your feelings  
you see you can do it  
i call it luck  
in my experience theres no such thing as luck  
good against remotes is one thing  
good against the living thats something else  
were coming up on alderaan  
i did feel something i could almost see the remote  
thats good youve taken your first step into a larger world  
yes  
our scout ships have reached dantooine  
they found the remains of a rebel base  
but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time  
they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems  
she lied she lied to us  
i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion  
terminate her immediately  
stand by chewie here we go cut in the sublight engines  
what the  
weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower  
some kind of asteroid collision  
 its not on any of the charts  whats going on  
our positions correct except no alderaan  
 where is it  thats what im trying to tell you  
it aint there its been blown away  
 what how  destroyed by the empire  
the entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet  
itd take a thousand ships with more firepower than ive  
 theres another ship coming in  maybe they know what happened  
its an imperial fighter  
 it followed us  no its a shortrange fighter  
there arent any bases around here where did it come from  
sure is leaving in a hurry if they identify us were in trouble  
not if i can help it chewie jam its transmissions  
 let it go its too far out of range  not for long  
a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own  
he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something  
he aint gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us  
hes heading for that small moon  
i can get him before he gets there hes almost in range  
thats no moon  
 its a space station  its too big to be a space station  
i have a very bad feeling about this  
turn the ship around  
yeah i think youre right full reverse  
chewie lock in the auxiliary power  
why are we still moving towards it  
were caught in a tractor beam its pulling us in  
theres gotta be something you can do  
theres nothing i can do im at full power i have to shut down  
theyre not gonna get me without a fight  
you cant win but there are alternatives to fighting  
clear bay 327  
we are opening the magnetic field  
to your stations come with me  
close all outboard shields close all outboard shields  
yes  
weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system  
its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley  
they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess  
she may yet be of some use to us  
unlock 1 5 7 and 9 release charge  
theres no one on board sir  
according to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff  
it must be a decoy several escape pods have been jettisoned  
 did you find any droids  no sir  
if there were any they must also have jettisoned  
send a scanning crew aboard i want every part of this ship checked  
yes sir  
i sense something  
a presence ive not felt since  
get me a scanning crew in here i want every part of this ship checked  
theres no one here  
boy its lucky you have these compartments  
i use them for smuggling i never thought id be smuggling myself in em  
this is ridiculous  
even if i could take off id never get past the tractor beam  
leave that to me  
damn fool i knew you were gonna say that  
whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him  
the ships all yours if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately  
all right lets go  
hey down there  
could you give us a hand with this  
tk421 why arent you at your post  
tk421 do you copy  
take over weve got a bad transmitter ill see what i can do  
between his howling and your blasting everything  
its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here  
bring em on i prefer a straight fight to sneakin around  
weve found the computer outlet sir  
plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial network  
hes found the controls to the power beam thats holding the ship here  
hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor  
the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations  
a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave  
i dont think you boys can help i must go alone  
whatever you say ive done more than i bargained for on this trip already  
 i want to go with you  be patient luke watch the droids  
they must be delivered safely  
or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan  
your destiny lies along a different path from mine  
the force will be with you  
always  
you said it chewie  
where did you dig up that old fossil  
ben is a great man  
 great at getting us into trouble  i didnt hear you give any ideas  
anythings better than just hangin around waiting for em to pick us up  
who do you think  
 what is it  im afraid im not quite sure sir  
he says ive found her and keeps repeating shes here  
who who has he found  
 princess leia  the princess shes here  
 princess  where is she

shes the one in the message we gotta help her  
dont get any funny ideas the old man wants us to wait here  
he didnt know she was here find a way into that detention block  
 im not going anywhere  theyre gonna execute her  
you said you didnt want to just wait to be captured now you want to stay  
marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind  
 but theyre gonna kill her  better her than me  
shes rich  
rich  
rich powerful if you were to rescue her the reward would be  
 what  well more well than you can imagine  
i dont know i can imagine quite a bit  
 youll get it  i better

 all right  whats your plan  
3po hand me those binders there will you

dont worry chewie i think i know what he has in mind  
master luke sir pardon me for asking  
but what should r2 and i do if were discovered here  
 lock the door  and hope they dont have blasters  
that isnt very reassuring  
517 to scan control 517 to scan control

yes  
we have an emergency alert in detention block aa23  
the princess put all sections on alert  
obiwan is here the force is with him

escape is not his plan i must face him alone  
get behind me get behind me  
watch your left they went down the cell bay  
 cant get out that way  you cut off our only escape route  
maybe youd like it back in your cell your highness  
 c3po c3po  yes sir

i think we took a wrong turn  
theres no lock  
 that oughta hold them for a while  quick weve got to get across  
 find the controls to extend the bridge  i think i just blasted it  
theyre coming through  
here hold this  
here they come  
for luck  
we think they may be splitting up they may be on level 5 and 6 now sir  
where could they be  
close the blast doors  
open the blast doors open the blast doors  
ive been waiting for you obiwan we meet again at last  
the circle is now complete  
when i left you i was but the learner  
now i am the master  
only a master of evil darth  
your powers are weak old man  
you cant win darth if you strike me down  
i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine  
you should not have come back  
didnt we just leave this party  
 what kept you  we ran into some old friends  
 the ship all right  seems okay if we can get to it  
i hope the old man got the tractor beam down  
look  
come on r2 were going  
nows our chance go  
come on  
 luke its too late  blast the door kid  
run luke run  
i hope that old man got the tractor beam down or this is gonna be a short trip hit it  
were coming up on their sentry ships  
hold them off angle the deflector shields while i charge up the main guns  
i cant believe hes gone  
there wasnt anything you could have done  
come on buddy were not out of this yet  
you in kid okay stay sharp  
here they come  
theyre coming in too fast  
 weve lost the lateral controls  dont worry shell hold together  
hear me baby hold together  
got him i got him  
great kid dont get cocky  
theres still two more  
 thats it we did it  we did it  
help i think im melting this is all your fault  
are they away  
theyve just made the jump into hyperspace  
youre sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship  
im taking an awful risk vader  
this had better work  
not a bad bit of rescuing huh  
you know sometimes i amaze even myself  
that doesnt sound too hard  
they let us go its the only explanation for the ease of our escape  
 you call that easy  theyre tracking us  
not this ship sister  
at least the information in r2 is still intact  
whats so important whats he carrying  
the technical readouts of that battle station  
i only hope that when the datas analyzed a weakness can be found  
 its not over yet  it is for me sister  
i aint in this for your revolution and im not in it for you princess  
i expect to be well paid im in it for the money  
you neednt worry about your reward  
if money is all that you love then thats what youll receive  
your friend is quite a mercenary  
i wonder if he really cares about anything or anybody  
i care  
so  
what do you think of her han  
im trying not to kid  
good  
still shes got a lot of spirit  
what do you think you think a princess and a guy like me  
no  
youre safe when we heard about alderaan we feared the worst  
we have no time for sorrows commander  
you must use the information in this r2 unit to help plan the attack  
its our only hope  
 yes  were approaching the planet yavin  
the rebel base is on a moon on the far side  
we are preparing to orbit the planet  
the battle station is heavily shielded  
and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet  
its defenses are designed around a direct largescale assault  
a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense  
pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters against that  
the empire doesnt consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat  
or theyd have a tighter defense  
an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia  
has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station  
the approach will not be easy  
youre required to maneuver straight down this trench  
and skim the surface to this point  
the target area is only two meters wide  
its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port  
the shaft leads directly to the reactor system  
a precise hit will start a chain reaction  
which should destroy the station  
only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction  
the shaft is rayshielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes  
thats impossible even for a computer  
no its not i used to bullseye womp rats in my t16 back home  
theyre not much bigger than two meters  
then man your ships and may the force be with you  
orbiting the planet at maximum velocity  
the moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes  
this will be a day long remembered  
it has seen the end of kenobi  
and will soon see the end of the rebellion  
all flight crews man your stations  
so you got your reward and youre just leaving then  
thats right yeah  
i got some old debts i gotta pay off with this stuff  
even if i didnt you dont think id be fool enough to stick around here do ya  
why dont you come with us youre pretty good in a fight we could use ya  
come on why dont you take a look around  
you know whats about to happen what theyre up against  
they could use a good pilot like you youre turning your back on them  
what goods a reward if you aint around to use it  
besides attacking that battle station aint my idea of courage  
its more like suicide  
all right well take care of yourself han  
i guess thats what youre best at isnt it  
hey luke  
may the force be with you  
what are you looking at i know what im doing  
all pilots to your stations  
 whats wrong  its han  
i dont know i really thought hed change his mind  
hes got to follow his own path no one can choose it for him  
i only wish ben were here  
open main launch tubes  
main launch tubes opening sir  
hey luke  
 biggs  i dont believe it how are ya

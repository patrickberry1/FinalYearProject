1
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,500
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,170
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,640
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,270
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,070
What's that?

7
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,880
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,900
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,110
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,490
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,700
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,510
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,220
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,140
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,190
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,900
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,860
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,910
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,920
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,310
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,310
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,390
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,780
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,370
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,080
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,130
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,550
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,970
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,310
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,460
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic--

36
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,630
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,840
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,810
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,980
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,020
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860
Holding her is dangerous.

45
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,490
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,950
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,750
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,750
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,500
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,090
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,300
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,840
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,140
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting,
but no life-forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,230
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,900
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,060
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

57
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,730
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,330
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,790
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,760
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,970
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,060
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,240
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,820
Well, I'm not going that way.

65
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,110
It's much too rocky.

66
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,620
This way is much easier.

67
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,120
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

68
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,620
Don't get technical with me.

69
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,960
What mission? What are you talking about?

70
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,380
I've just about had enough of you.

71
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,420
Go that way.

72
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,340
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

73
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,100
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

74
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,680
because you won't get it.

75
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,860
No more adventures.

76
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,950
I'm not going that way.

77
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

78
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,070
He tricked me into going this way...

79
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,080
but he'll do no better.

80
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,460
Wait. What's that?

81
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,290
A transport. I'm saved.

82
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,130
Over here!

83
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,840
Hey! Hey!

84
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,380
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,890
R2?

86
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,690
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,470
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,430
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,410
We stopped.

90
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,290
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,840
We're doomed.

92
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,140
Do you think they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,110
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

94
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,700
Will this never end?

95
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,530
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,110
Luke!

97
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,620
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,250
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,600
No, not that one.

101
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,350
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--

103
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,860
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,700
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--

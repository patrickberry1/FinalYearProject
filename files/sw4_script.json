A little\nfurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a\npair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the\nnarrow path.\nThe unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until\nsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out\nof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages\none short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his\nback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then\noff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller\nthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they\ncautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and\ntheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be\nseen.
